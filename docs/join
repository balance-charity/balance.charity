## Get Involved!

### We need your help!

With your participation, we hope to expand the frequency
and variety of services we provide. This will include
daily programing at a permanent drop-in center and critical
staff members who can provide full-time services.

You can help too! If you are anywhere near Jerusalem,
reach out to Shmuel Nachman via
[shmuel@balance.charity](mailto:shmuel@balance.charity)
to see how you can get involved on the ground.

Alternatively, your donation will enable us to acquire
a more permanent location with which we will reach ever
more at-risk children and young adults.
