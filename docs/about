# THE BALANCE


## Shlomo Mizrahi

After suffering a close personal
loss due to drug overdose, Shlomo's entire
life was changed and his  priorities shifted
immediately. He took on a new life mission:
to help abandoned, abused, or otherwise neglected

similar tragedies.


## Shmuel Nachman
### Co-Founder and Head of Operations

As a young kid, Shmuel the unwavering certainty
of his strict orthodox community for the deceptive
allure of freedom on the streets of Jerusalem. During
this time he witnessed widespread drug abuse, rampant
 sexual assault, and unnecessary violence amongst his
peers. These firsthand experiences inspired him to escape
this lifestyle and be sober. Today, he dedicates his
life to help other make the same choice and take back
their life.
