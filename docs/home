<h2> Our Mission </h2>

The Balance seeks to save at-risk youth from falling prey
to violence, drug abuse, and sexual assault
on the streets of Jerusalem and beyond.
We foster a space that provides the emotional,
physical, and spiritual support at-risk youth
need to rise above their circumstances
and develop their full potential.
