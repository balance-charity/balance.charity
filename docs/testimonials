### This organization was started in beloved memory of Tehilla Bat Michal.

My name is Michal Chen, mother of 4 beautiful children.
My oldest daughter, Tehilla was such a bright, smart and talented girl.
She loved to help others and was very loving and everyone loved her.
As she got older, life became more challenging and was hard for her
to deal with her emotions, she searched for unhealthy ways to comfort
her pain and it was very difficult to find emotional support socially
and mentally. I wish she had an outlet that would be a safe healthy
place so she wouldn't feel alone. By the time she was 16.5,
she fell to drugs and by 18, Tehilla tragically left this world due
to the addiction of fatal drugs. Our story is incredibly heartbreaking,
a beautiful girl with a whole life ahead of her was taken away from us.
I really hope that the kids today can feel that there is a place for
them to just be accepted and loved for who they are in a healthy social
environment so that they won't look to numb their pain in destructive ways.
