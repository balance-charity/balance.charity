		<h3>What are we doing now?</h3>
		<p>We are currently running a late night Thursday program in Jerusalem.
		We rely on donated food, donated space, and donated time. We'd love
		to get you more involved, or if you are in need of our services,
		we'd love to help you out!</p>
		<p>Contact Shmuel via <a href="mailto:shmuel@balance.charity">shmuel@balance.charity</a> for more information.</p>
		<h3>What are we missing and how can you help?</h3>
		<p>We are missing <strong>YOU!</strong></p>
		<p>With your participation, we hope to expand the frequency
		and variety of services we provide. This will include
		daily programing at a permanent drop-in center and critical
		staff members who can provide full-time services.</p>
		<p>You can help too! If you are anywhere near Jerusalem,
		reach out to Shmuel Nachman via
		<a href="mailto:shmuel@balance.charity">shmuel@balance.charity</a>
		to see how you can get involved on the ground.</p>
		<p>Alternatively, your donation will enable us to acquire
		a more permanent location with which we will reach ever
		more at-risk children and young adults.</p><hr />
