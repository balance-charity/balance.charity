		<h2>Shlomo Mizrahi</h2>
		<h3>Co-Founder and Head of Fundraising</h3>
		<p>After suffering a close personal
		loss due to drug overdose, Shlomo's entire
		life was changed and his  priorities shifted
		immediately. He took on a new life mission:
		to help abandoned, abused, or otherwise neglected
		children and young adults and save them from
		similar tragedies.</p>
		<h2>Shmuel Nachman</h2>
		<h3>Co-Founder and Head of Operations</h3>
		<p>As a young kid, Shmuel left the unwavering certainty
		of his strict orthodox community for the deceptive
		allure of freedom on the streets of Jerusalem. During
		this time he witnessed widespread drug abuse, rampant
		sexual assault, and unnecessary violence amongst his
		peers. These firsthand experiences inspired him to escape
		this lifestyle and be sober. Today, he dedicates his
		life to help other make the same choice and take back
		their life.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Volunteers</h2>
		<p>Our program relies the time and effort
		generously shared by our many wonderful volunteers.
		We recieve help from a wide variety of volunteers
		including dancers, religious leaders,
		therapists, musicians, recovered drug-users, and people
		of all walks of life.</p>
		<h3>We need your help!</h3>
		<p>With your participation, we hope to expand the frequency
		and variety of services we provide. This will include
		daily programing at a permanent drop-in center and critical
		staff members who can provide full-time services.</p>
		<p>You can help too! If you are anywhere near Jerusalem,
		reach out to Shmuel Nachman via
		<a href="mailto:shmuel@balance.charity">shmuel@balance.charity</a>
		to see how you can get involved on the ground.</p>
		<p>Alternatively, your donation will enable us to acquire
		a more permanent location with which we will reach ever
		more at-risk children and young adults.</p><hr />
