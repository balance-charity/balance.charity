			<h2>The Team</h2>
			<hr />
			<h4>Shlomo Mizrahi</h4>
			<h6>Co-Founder and Head of Fundraising</h6>
			<p class="lead">After suffering a close personal
			loss due to drug overdose, Shlomo's entire
			life was changed and his  priorities shifted
			immediately. He took on a new life mission:
			to help abandoned, abused, or otherwise neglected
			children and young adults and save them from
			similar tragedies.</p>
			<hr />
			<h4>Shmuel Nachman</h4>
			<h6>Co-Founder and Head of Operations</h6>
			<p class="lead">As a young kid, Shmuel left the unwavering certainty
			of his strict orthodox community for the deceptive
			allure of freedom on the streets of Jerusalem. During
			this time he witnessed widespread drug abuse, rampant
			sexual assault, and unnecessary violence amongst his
			peers. These firsthand experiences inspired him to escape
			this lifestyle and be sober. Today, he dedicates his
			life to help other make the same choice and take back
			their life.</p>
			<hr />

			<h2>Volunteers</h2>
			<p class="lead">Our program relies the time and effort
			generously shared by our many wonderful volunteers.
			We recieve help from a wide variety of volunteers
			including dancers, religious leaders,
			therapists, musicians, recovered drug-users, and people
			of all walks of life.</p>
			<h3>We need your help!</h3>
			<p class="lead">With your participation, we hope to expand the frequency
			and variety of services we provide. This will include
			daily programing at a permanent drop-in center and critical
			staff members who can provide full-time services.</p>
			<p class="lead">You can help too! If you are anywhere near Jerusalem,
			reach out to Shmuel Nachman via
			<a href="mailto:shmuel@balance.charity">shmuel@balance.charity</a>
			to see how you can get involved on the ground.</p>
			<p class="lead">Alternatively, your donation will enable us to acquire
			a more permanent location with which we will reach ever
			more at-risk children and young adults.</p>
